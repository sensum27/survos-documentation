Turk Jobs
=========

Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) is a marketplace for crowd-sourced work. The Posse Platform enables a user
to create what AMT calls *external HITs*, which are tasks run outside of the AMT system. Internal hits
for AMT are somewhat limited. With a Turk job, a task is posted and a crowd of anonymous users has a
chance to accept individual assignments and complete the task. This is particularly good for gathering
data about a photo, where if a group of anonymous people reach consensus about something, it is likely
to be valid.
