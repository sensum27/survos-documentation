Mobile Jobs
===========

Mobile jobs are surveys taken in the field about a person's attitude, behavior or perception. They can
also be data collection surveys. These jobs can also be called "Ecological Momentary Assessments", or EMAs.
These jobs are entirely different from Turk jobs, as the participants are often known to the survey
administrator, enrolled, may be compensated, etc.

Here's a list

- `Surveys <http://flow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/topic/dashboard/2-surveys.html>`_ : Surveys are the centerpiece of the Akvo FLOW application. Create, edit and publish surveys from the Surveys tab.
- `Devices <http://flow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/topic/dashboard/3-devices.html>`_ : In the devices tab you manage the devices connected with your Akvo FLOW Dashboard.
- `Data <http://flow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/topic/dashboard/4-data.html>`_ : The Data tab is where you can view, edit, import and clean data collected with Akvo FLOW surveys.
- `Reports <http://flow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/topic/dashboard/5-reports.html>`_ : The Reports tab in FLOW gives you several options for viewing and exporting data and results from your surveys.
- `Maps <http://flow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/topic/dashboard/6-maps.html>`_ : The map on your Dashboard shows the surveys collected with a GPS location as points on a map.
- `Users <http://flow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/topic/dashboard/7-users.html>`_ : User permissions on the Dashboard are divided into two levels: User and Admin. 
- `Messages <http://flow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/topic/dashboard/8-messages.html>`_ : The Messages tab lists messages on your dashboard related to activity with surveys and data processing activity.

Access to each tool menu is limited by permissions so not all functions will be available to all users. 

**Important - There is no "Back" button on the Dashboard!** 

All Dashboard pages are contained and displayed within your organizations Dashboard URL. This means that clicking your browser's "Back" arrow button will take you away from the Dashboard to whatever webpage you had previously visited before starting your Dashboard session. Instead, clicking on **Dashboard** will always bring you back to the Dashboard home. 
   
The Akvo FLOW Development Team frequently updates the Dashboard with new or enhanced features, so check our github page for updates at https://github.com/akvo/akvo-flow/releases.

The Dashboard is controlled by permissions and a free Gmail account is required in order to access the Dashboard. If you do not already have a Gmail account, go to https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount and create one and then email your Gmail username to a FLOW administrator and they will give you access to the Dashboard.
