Creating A Job
==============

These are the types of mobile jobs you can create:
 * SMS: Participants do surveys via an exchange of SMS Messages
 * MMS: Participants collect photos, and possibly some data, using the camera phones and send it to a shortcode.
 * IVR: Participants take surveys via a voice-prompted system, and respond via the touch-pad on their phones.
 * Survos Mobile: Participants download Survos Mobile to their ios or android device, and take the survey on their smartphone.
